# Gollab
Gollab is a library written in pure Go providing basic functionality needed to implement a collaborative editor similar
to Google Docs or Office 365. Gollab has zero external dependencies.

## Documentation
The project is self-documented in its source code - check out the auto-generated documentation at
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/danielslee/gollab).

## Examples
You can check out a working example [here](https://editor.learningspoons.danslee.com). I'm working on setting up
a repository with a bunch of examples and a separate library providing WebAssembly, WebSocket and Redis integrations
(as used in the example above).
